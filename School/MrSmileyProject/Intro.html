        <p>Homework 4</p>
        <p>Created By Daniel Herman</p>
        <p>CSCI 360</p>

        What an incredibly frustrating project until it all came together and worked beautifully! <br>
        Apologies for the slightly unorganized code, I ran out of time to clean it up completely; particularly in the smiley class.<br><br>

        There is no fun gameplay, just a simple stroll through the park. <br><br>
